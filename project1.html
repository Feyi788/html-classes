    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>First things first </h3>
    <p> Husband, father, son, brother, uncle, friend, mentor, type 1
        diabetic, INTJ, porcupine.</p>
    <p> All my family comes from Cincinnati</p>
    <p> I was born in the suburbs of New Haven, Connecticut, and raised in
        Nothern Virginia, just outside the Capital Beltway</p>
    <p> Now I live in Seattle with my wife, our new kid, and our dog Olive.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3> <b>Professional background</b> </h3>
    <p> I'm in the business of making things sense. My mother might tell you
        i'm a graphic designer, or maybe a web designer-and she's not wrong. There's just more to it than that.</p>
    <p> I spent the formative years of my career with small design studios
        and strategic communications firms serving nonprofits and misson-driven organizations like American Society of
        Civil Engineers, Anne E. Casey Foundation, Human Rights Campaign, National Association of Independent Schools,
        and Ploughshares Fund.</p>
    <p> I also held positions inside larger organizations. First with
        National Journal Group (subsidiary of The Atlantic) the DC-based media platform and research consultancy. Then
        with Seattle Indian Health Board, a federally qualified health center and urban Indian Health program serving
        American Indian and Alaska Native people across the country.</p>
    <p> Nowadays I use design thinking to help the people and organizations
        grow and do things in their communities. You can hire me to help with practially anything.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> <b>Formal Education</b> </h3>
    <p> I hold a BFA with honors in Graphic Design from the Corcoran College
        of Art + Design in Washington, DC (before it became part of George Washington University). My senior thesis
        explored the benefits and pitfalls of three budding social impact programs.</p>
    <p> Before pursuing an education in design, I spent two years at Miami
        University of Ohio studying literature and creative writing. That short time left a big impression, though, and
        i still harbor a strong urge to write. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> <b>Personal interests</b> </h3>
    <p> When i'm not taking care of the kid, i'm throwing the frisbee for
        Olive or busy being a Big Brother<sup>TM</sup>. I like stage comedy, artsy horror movies, home organization
        projects, bouldering, ping pong, roller skating, woodworking ,ice hockey, coming up with band games, and
        collecting flea market dinosaur figurines. I used to hunt for funky neon signs around the city and share my
        browser tab. I love surfing the world wide web.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>This website </h3>
    <p> This is my personal website, a quiet little tract of cyberspace where
        i collect my thoughts and share ideas. You"ll find blog posts, notes, etc. and other miscellaneous pages. (If
        you're interested in the nitty gritty details, you can read more about this website.)</p>
    <p> Like Zeldman says: There are many like it, but this one is mine.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
